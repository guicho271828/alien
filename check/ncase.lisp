;;;; NCASE - optimise CASE to a jump table
;;; $Id: ncase.lisp,v 1.1 2003/10/12 10:41:30 tfb Exp $

;;; This is an example of using macros to do some fairly low-level
;;; optimisation.  NCASE is like CASE, but in suitable cases it will
;;; compile a jump-table instead of lots of tests.  This is actually
;;; not a really good example because the compiler is likely to be
;;; able to do a better job of the decisions involved, and it can also
;;; use real jumps rather than function calls which only may turn into
;;; jumps.
;;;
;;; This code has had basically no testing and may be buggy.
;;;

;;; *NCASE-PREDICATE* gets called with a key list (all integers)
;;; and can decide if this should be optimised or not.  This version
;;; only optimises if there are enough keys (so the NCASE statement is
;;; fairly big, requiring lots of tests, and if they are dense enough
;;; in their range to avoid making a huge sparse array.
