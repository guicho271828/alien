;; Successor generator is originally a structure similar to decision-tree.
;; Its internal nodes are selector nodes which have several children where each child
;; corresponds to a value of a SAS variable.
;; The leaf nodes are generator nodes.

;; Ours does not handle SAS encoding, and rather a binary encoding.
;; each node has then/else/either branches. to generate a list of applicable operators,
;; traverse the tree as follows:
;; When the current value of the variable is true, follow THEN branch and EITHER branch.
;; When the current value of the variable is false, follow ELSE branch and EITHER branch.
